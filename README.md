# Research Paper → POC Workflow

Transform academic research papers into working prototypes through a systematic, AI-assisted approach. This workflow takes you from paper discovery to working demonstration in 1-3 weeks, with clear go/no-go decision points and structured AI collaboration.

## 🎯 What This Workflow Achieves

**Primary Goal:** Create working proof-of-concepts that demonstrate the core ideas from research papers

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ Demonstrates the paper's main algorithmic contribution
- ✅ Runs end-to-end without manual intervention
- ✅ Produces interpretable and validatable results
- ✅ Documented well enough for others to understand and extend
- ✅ Completed within reasonable timeframe (days to weeks, not months)

**What This Is NOT:**
- ❌ Production-ready implementation
- ❌ Perfect replication of paper results
- ❌ Comprehensive literature review
- ❌ Novel research contribution

### Time Investment by Complexity
- **Simple Paper (1-3 days):** Well-described algorithm, available datasets, clear methodology
- **Medium Paper (1 week):** Some implementation challenges, need to adapt datasets, moderate complexity
- **Complex Paper (2-3 weeks):** Novel algorithms, significant implementation challenges, requires experimentation

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of the paper's domain (ML, systems, algorithms, etc.)
- Development environment for your preferred language (Python, JavaScript, etc.)
- Access to AI coding assistants (GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, Claude)

### Step 1: Set Up Your Project
```bash
# Clone the workflows repository
git clone <ai-workflows-repo>
cd ai-workflows

# Create new project from template
cp -r workflows/research-paper-poc/templates projects/my-paper-poc
cd projects/my-paper-poc

# Customize the project
# Edit project-context.md with your paper details
# Follow phase-by-phase execution
```

### Step 2: Execute the Workflow
1. **Start with Stage 1:** Paper analysis and feasibility assessment
2. **Use AI collaboration:** Follow provided prompts for each stage
3. **Track progress:** Update tickets and checkpoints as you go
4. **Make go/no-go decisions:** Don't proceed with unfeasible projects

## 📊 Decision Framework

### Go/No-Go Criteria (Stage 1)
**✅ GREEN LIGHT - Proceed with confidence:**
- Core algorithm is clearly described with mathematical formulation
- Required datasets are publicly available or can be synthesized
- Computational requirements are reasonable for your setup
- Dependencies are available in your technology stack
- Paper includes reproducibility information (code/data links)

**🟡 YELLOW LIGHT - Proceed with caution:**
- Algorithm description is mostly clear but missing some details
- Datasets need adaptation or synthetic generation
- Moderate computational requirements (might need cloud resources)
- Some dependencies require learning or setup
- Limited reproducibility information

**🔴 RED LIGHT - Do not proceed:**
- Algorithm description is too vague or incomplete
- Requires proprietary datasets or models not available
- Computational requirements exceed available resources
- Needs specialized hardware you don't have access to
- Paper is purely theoretical without implementation guidance

### Complexity Assessment
**Simple (1-3 days):**
- Algorithm is straightforward (e.g., new loss function, simple architecture modification)
- Standard datasets available (MNIST, CIFAR, common NLP datasets)
- Uses familiar libraries and frameworks
- Clear evaluation metrics and success criteria

**Medium (1 week):**
- Moderate algorithmic complexity (new model architecture, optimization technique)
- Datasets need preprocessing or adaptation
- Requires integration of multiple components
- Some novel evaluation or visualization needed

**Complex (2-3 weeks):**
- Novel or intricate algorithms requiring careful implementation
- Custom datasets or complex data pipelines
- Multiple interdependent components
- Significant experimental validation required

## 💡 Tips for Success

**Start Small:** Choose papers with clear algorithms and available data for your first few attempts

**Time-box Everything:** Don't spend more than planned time on any stage - move forward or pivot

**Document Assumptions:** Capture what you assume vs. what you validate - helps with debugging

**Use Version Control:** Track iterations and be able to revert when experiments fail

**Embrace "Good Enough":** POCs prove concepts, not production readiness

**Learn from Failures:** Failed POCs often teach more than successful ones - document the lessons
